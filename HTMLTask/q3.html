              <p>
                In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama
                has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of
                our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first
                African American to serve in that role—she helped create the
                most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also
                establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls
                in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways
                that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and
                standing with her husband as he led America through some of its
                most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance
                moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth
                daughters under an unforgiving media glare.
              </p>
              <p>
                In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing
                storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world,
                chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her
                childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an
                executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her
                time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring
                honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her
                disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story
                as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms.

                  <p>
                    For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley
                    Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late
                    1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals
                    immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But
                    Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has
                    survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home,
                    finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then
                    the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When
                    two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty,
                    Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable
                    happens.

                    As the founder of the lifestyle website TheChicSite.com and
                    CEO of her own media company, Rachel Hollis developed an

                    while fearlessly revealing the messiness of her own life.
                    Now, in this challenging and inspiring new book, Rachel
                    exposes the twenty lies and misconceptions that too often

                    Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, Tara
                    Westover was seventeen the first time she set foot in a
                    classroom. Her family was so isolated from mainstream
                    society that there was no one to ensure the children
                    received an education, and no one to intervene when one of
                    Tara’s older brothers became violent. When another brother
                    got himself into college, Tara decided to try a new kind of
                    life. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her
                    over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to
                    Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if she’d
                    traveled too far, if there was still a way home.
